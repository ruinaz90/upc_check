# UPC Check
An application to check if a UPC is valid. Input an 11 or 12 digit code to calculate the check digit.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** Python

## Optimizations
This started as an application to check if a UPC is valid or not. It was later optimized to calculate the check digit so the user can see what the correct digit should be instead of only if the UPC is valid.

## Lessons Learned
I learned to think about what the user would want in an application and what they can use it for. It was useful for the user to be able to validate a UPC, but it was more useful to also include the check digit calculation.
